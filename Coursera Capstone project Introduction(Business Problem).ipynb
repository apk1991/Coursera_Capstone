    "British Columbia is more heavily Asian, Ontario has the greatest diversity, Alberta has overtaken Quebec both in numbers and diversity, and Quebec reflects the preference for French-speaking immigrants.\n",
    "The diversity of Canada’s population is expected to increase significantly in the next two decades, especially in the large metropolitan cities.  Statistics Canada projects by 2031, between 25 to 28 percent of the population will be foreign-born and 29 to 32 percent of the population will belong to a visible minority group.  Visible minorities are expected to account for 63 percent of the population of Toronto, 59 percent of Vancouver and 31 percent of Montreal.\n",
